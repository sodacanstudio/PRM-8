Subject: Discovery of Level FUN

Date: 11/15/2016

Found Item Location: Elevator Log, South Terminal

Note Contents:

"Mission log, Agent 006 reporting. I was cycling through the elevator sequences during my sweep of Level 1 when something... unusual happened. At first, it was a standard sequence. Familiar hum of the machinery, the faint flickering of the overhead light, the usual stale air. But then the controls glitched out.

The panel displayed 'FUN,' in all caps. I’d never seen it listed before. Curiosity got the better of me, and I pressed it.

The doors slid open to what looked like a party—a warped, garish version of one. Streamers and balloons scattered everywhere, but the air was wrong. It was suffocatingly silent, except for faint giggling echoing from nowhere and everywhere at once. I could feel eyes on me, though I saw nothing at first.

I stepped out, careful and slow, and immediately noticed the cake. A massive one, dead center in the room, with "WELCOME TO THE PARTY!" crudely scrawled on it. As I approached, shapes began to emerge from the shadows—party-goers, humanlike, but wrong. Their movements jittered, as if their strings were being pulled. They wore twisted smiles, and their hollow, unblinking eyes locked onto me.

I didn’t stick around long enough to learn more. I darted back to the elevator, and the moment the doors shut, I could swear the laughter turned into a deafening roar.

Retrieval from this level is not recommended. Proceed with extreme caution if FUN is ever accessed again."_

Additional Notes:

Recommend disabling FUN from elevator panels if possible.
Requesting investigation into how this level connects to others and the entity presence within.
Reminder: Stay vigilant. The Backrooms play by their own rules.
Signed,
